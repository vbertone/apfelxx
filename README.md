__A PDF evolution library in C++__

# Introduction
 
APFEL++ is a C++ rewriting of the Fortran 77 code
[APFEL](https://github.com/vbertone/apfel) originally conceived to
evolve collinear parton distribution functions (PDFs). However,
APFEL++ is based on a completely new code design and guarantees a
better performance along with a more optimal memory management. The
new modular structure allows for better maintainability and easier
extensibility. This makes APFEL++ suitable for a wide range of tasks:
from the solution of the DGLAP evolution equations to the computation
of deep-inelastic-scattering (DIS) and single-inclusive-annihilation
cross sections. Also more complex computations, such as differential
semi-inclusive DIS and Drell-Yan cross sections, are easily
implementable in APFEL++.

APFEL++ is used as a prediction engine in:
[NangaParbat](https://github.com/vbertone/NangaParbat), a code devoted
to the extraction of Trasverse-Momentum-Dependent (TMD) distributions;
[MontBlanc](https://github.com/vbertone/MontBlanc), a code for the
determination of collinear fragmentation functions (FFs); and
[Denali](https://github.com/MapCollaboration/Denali), a code for the
determination of collinear longitudinally polarised PDFs. APFEL++ is
also currently interfaced to
[PARTONS](http://partons.cea.fr/partons/doc/html/index.html), a
software dedicated to the phenomenology of Generalised Parton
Distributions (GPDs) and TMDs, and to
[xFitter](https://www.xfitter.org/xFitter/), an open source fit
framework devoted to the extraction of collinear distributions and to
the assessment of the impact of new experimental data.

## Homebrew (macOS)

APFEL++ is available through the
[Homebrew-hep](https://github.com/davidchall/homebrew-hep) tap of
[Homebrew](https://brew.sh). After having installed Homebrew and
tapped Homebrew-hep, the latest stable release of APFEL++ can be
downloaded and installed with:
```Shell
brew install apfel++
```

## Download

You can obtain APFEL++ directly from the GitHub repository:

https://github.com/vbertone/apfelxx/releases

For the latest development branch you can clone the master code:

```Shell
git clone https://github.com/vbertone/apfelxx.git
```

If you instead want to download a specific tag:

```Shell
git tag -l
git checkout tags/tag_name
```
## Installation 

The code can be compiled using the following procedure:

```Shell
cd apfelxx
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/your/installation/path/ ..
make && make install
```
By the default, if no prefix is given, the program will
be installed in the /usr/local folder. If you want (or need) to use a
different path, remember to export the APFEL++ `/lib` and `/bin` folders into the
`$LD_LIBRARY_PATH` and `$PATH`, respectively. More configuration options can be accessed by typing:

```Shell
ccmake .
```
The library can be uninstalled by running:
```
make clean
xargs rm < install_manifest.txt
```
