Modifications to the original ancillary file

- Moved ancillary_pol.inc -> ancillary_pol.frm
- replace "id" in front of each expression with "Local"
- Defined variables adding at the beginning the lines:

F Dd, Dn, ln, Li2, Li3, T, ArcTan, InvTanInt;
S x, z, NC, NF, pi, zeta3;
S LMUF, LMUA, LMUR;
S [1-x], [1-z], [1-x-z], [x-z], [1+x], [1+z], [z-1];
S sqrtxz1, sqrtxz2, sqrtxz3, poly2;
S u1, u2, u3, u4, t1, t2, r1, r2;

*S DC1Q2Q, DC1Q2G, DC1G2Q;
*S DC2Q2G, DC2G2G, DC2G2Q, DC2Q2QNS, DC2Q2QPS, DC2Q2QB, DC2Q2QP1, DC2Q2QP2, DC2Q2QP3;

- Replaced all instances of "rln2" with "ln(2)"

- Terminated the file with:

* Available coefficient functions
* NLO: DC1Q2Q, DC1Q2G, DC1G2Q
* NNLO: DC2Q2G, DC2G2G, DC2G2Q, DC2Q2QNS, DC2Q2QPS, DC2Q2QB, DC2Q2QP1, DC2Q2QP2, DC2Q2QP3

Print DC1Q2Q, DC1Q2G, DC1G2Q;
Print DC2Q2G, DC2G2G, DC2G2Q, DC2Q2QNS, DC2Q2QPS, DC2Q2QB, DC2Q2QP1, DC2Q2QP2, DC2Q2QP3;
