Modifications to the original ancillary file

- Moved ancillary.inc -> ancillary.frm
- replace "id" in front of each expression with "Local"
- Defined variables adding at the beginning the lines:

F Dd, Dn, ln, Li2, Li3, T, ArcTan, InvTanInt;
S x, z, NC, NF, pi, zeta3;
S LMUF, LMUA, LMUR;
S [1-x], [1-z], [1-x-z], [x-z], [1+x], [1+z], [z-1];
S sqrtxz1, sqrtxz2, sqrtxz3, poly2;
S u1, u2, u3, u4, t1, t2, r1, r2;

*S C1LQ2Q, C1LQ2G, C1LG2Q, C1TQ2Q, C1TQ2G, C1TG2Q;
*S C2LQ2G, C2LG2G, C2LG2Q, C2LQ2QNS, C2LQ2QPS, C2LQ2QB, C2LQ2QP1, C2LQ2QP2, C2LQ2QP3, C2TQ2G, C2TG2G, C2TG2Q, C2TQ2QNS, C2TQ2QPS, C2TQ2QB, C2TQ2QP1, C2TQ2QP2, C2TQ2QP3;

- Terminated the file with:

* Available coefficient functions
* NLO: C1LQ2Q, C1LQ2G, C1LG2Q, C1TQ2Q, C1TQ2G, C1TG2Q;
* NNLO: C2LQ2G, C2LG2G, C2LG2Q, C2LQ2QNS, C2LQ2QPS, C2LQ2QB, C2LQ2QP1, C2LQ2QP2, C2LQ2QP3, C2TQ2G, C2TG2G, C2TG2Q, C2TQ2QNS, C2TQ2QPS, C2TQ2QB, C2TQ2QP1, C2TQ2QP2, C2TQ2QP3;

Print C1LQ2Q, C1LQ2G, C1LG2Q, C1TQ2Q, C1TQ2G, C1TG2Q;
